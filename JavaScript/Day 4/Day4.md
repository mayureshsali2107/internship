* Array

-An array is a collection of similar data elements stored in continuous memory locations.
-Elements are accessed using their index (starting from 0).


* for-each loop

-A for-each loop is a simplified loop used to iterate over elements in a collection or array directly, without using an index variable. It's often clearer and less error-prone than traditional loops when you simply want to process every item

* map

-The map() method is used to transform each element of an array.
-It applies a function to every element and returns a new array with the modified values.
-The original array remains unchanged.


* filter

-The filter() method is used to extract elements from an array that meet a specific condition.
-It returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the given condition.

   
* Methods Of Array

slice():
-Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

fill():
-Fills all or part of an array with a static value.

some():
-Checks if at least one element satisfies a condition.
