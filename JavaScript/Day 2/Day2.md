                6] Conditional Statements


* String  
-It is Collection Of Characters.
-In which There Are Several Methods
 such as :
 lenght,slice,trim,toUpperCase,toLowerCase

 length is use for finding the length of String.
 Slice is Used for Printing the specific character from Original String  syntax slice(startindex,endindex+1)
 trim is use to trim the spaces from the Original String.
 toUpperCase is use to convert Original String into Upper case.
 toLowerCase is use to convert original string into lower case.


* Loops
-Loops are use to print the Statement Multiple Times
-In JavaScript there are several Loops available
 such as :
 for loop,while loop,do while loop etc.

 for is use to print statement multiple times syntax= for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){}
 while loop is first check the condition if condition is true then loop is execute
 do while loop first execute then the condition is checked.

* Operators
-Operators are use to perform the specific task
-In JavaScript There are several types of Operators 
 such as :
 Arithmetic ,logical,Assignment,Comparison

 arithmetic operators = (+,-,*,%,/)
 logical (&&,||,!)
 Assignment(==,+=,-+,*=)



 üìú A Brief History of HTML, the Language of the Web

An enormous number of websites are produced using HTML (HyperText Markup Language)‚Äîbut how did this important piece of digital architecture come to be? Let‚Äôs walk through their histories in simpler terms.

üåê First there was HTML 1.0 (1991-1993)

Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML at CERN in 1991 in order to link documents on the (then) immature World-Wide-Web. HTML was a simple language in its early years, owing to having only 18 tags, which facilitated enough capability to incorporate text and hyperlinks on web pages.

üöÄ From HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01 (1995-1999)

HTML 2.0 (1995): this is the first version of HTML to be standardized (by the IETF), and also the point at which varying browser offerings began to formalize early HTML feature sets.

HTML 3.2 (1997): this was significant because HTML now supported tables in HTML documents. HTML 4.01 (1999): for the first time, the HTML language clearly distinguished between content and design. HTML was now wrapped in CSS as a recommended approach of transforming content with publisher-defined design.

üìâ Decline and Rise: XHTML (2000s)

In the early 2000s, focus shifted away from HTML to XHTML which was to be the future of the language of the web. XHTML was stricter, XML-based 'sibling' of HTML. It also represented a more structured document model that was complex and troublesome for most developers, so most developers moved-on from XHTML ignoring its stricter features and inflexible syntax. Searching through my old HTML files and XHTML files, I would estimate 50-75% of the old XHTML files were simply files with a .xhtml extension and there was no way they could conform to stricter syntax.

‚ö° The New HTML: HTML5 (2014)

After sitting through all of the HTML/XHTML stagnation, two groups (WHATWG and W3C) came together to provide a common direction for HTML5 development. HTML5 brought a huge paradigm shift, in the sense that:

- native support for audio, video and scalable graphics (SVG).

- semantic tags: body, header, footer.

- support for offline storage APIs.
