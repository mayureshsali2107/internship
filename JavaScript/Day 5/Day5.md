-Document body access & logging
Uses document.body to reference the page’s main container and logs it to the console 

-Dynamic element creation
Creates new elements (<div>, <img>) with document.createElement() and inserts them using appendChild() 

-Content insertion
Uses innerHTML to add formatted HTML content within the <div>, including line breaks and inline styling 

-Inline styling via .style
Applies CSS properties (e.g. background, display, margin, typography) directly in JavaScript using the style object 

-Flexbox layout manipulation
Sets up a basic layout using CSS Flexbox through script, e.g. display: flex, justify-content: space-between.

-Image styling and attributes
Dynamically controls image appearance (dimensions, border, shadow, radius, margin), by setting attributes and style properties directly

-Benefits & limitations: Direct DOM manipulation is powerful but can be error-prone in large codebases—inline styles are hard to maintain and less reusable than CSS classes
